## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of ResolvFlow up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager, usually comes with Node.js)
  * **MongoDB** (running locally or access to a cloud-hosted instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ResolvFlow
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**

    Navigate to the `backend` directory (or wherever your backend code resides).

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

    Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables:

    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/resolvflow_db" # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
    SESSION_SECRET="your_very_secret_key_here" # Generate a strong, random string
    JWT_SECRET="another_very_secret_key" # For user authentication tokens
    CLIENT_ORIGIN="http://localhost:5173" # Your frontend URL
    ```

    Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified PORT).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    Navigate to the `frontend` directory (or wherever your frontend code resides).

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

    Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add your environment variables:

    ```env
    VITE_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3000" # Your backend URL
    ```

    Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:5173`.
